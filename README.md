# Client-Server-Disease-Application

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the utility of multithreaded programming and internetworking with sockets. We implement a distributed system that will provide the same functionality as the [Disease-Aggregator-Application](https://github.com/PanPapag/Disease-Aggregator-Application).
